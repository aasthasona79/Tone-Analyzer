#Tone-Analyzer
In today's world, we face a problem of conveying our emotions and thoughts properly on text message. Not everyone of us have an outstanding command over English Language, which makes it even more difficult when talking to someone who has. Our web app analyzes the tone of a text message classifying your message with tones of happiness, sadness, confidence, anger and disgust so you can know the correct emotion of your message that you want to convey and avoid misinterpretations. The app is built on Django-1.9 and uses IBM Watson's API for sentiment analysis.# Tone-Analyzer
